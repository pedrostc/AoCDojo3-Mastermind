## Getting started with this repository
You'll need [Node.Js](https://nodejs.org/) installed to be able to utilize this repository.

After cloning, run `npm install` on the root of this repository to install all necessary dependencies.

To run tests, you can use the `npm run test` command. If you want to enable file watch, so the tests re-run automatically after saving a file, you can use the `npm run test:watch` command.

The test framework is configured to look for files inside of the `src` folder and to look for test files with the `.spec.js` extension.
